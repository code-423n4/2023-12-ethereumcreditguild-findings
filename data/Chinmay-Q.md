The Bidding mechanism in an auction involves sending some collateral to the borrower of the loan if the bid has happened before midPoint( of auction). AuctionHouse.bid function calls LendingTerm.onBid which transfers collateralToken to the borrower if it is !=0. The problem is that if the collateralToken chosen has a blacklisting functionality which is present in some tokens (such as USDC/USDT etc.),  then this transfer can fail if the borrower gets blacklisted for some reason. This will lead to bid failure and brick the auction mechanism till the time of midPoint after which collateralToBorrower will be zero by default.

This will lead to the borrower losing on some collateral he could get back if a fair bid was there, or if he himself is trying to repay via bids. 

Wrap this collateral transfer in a try-catch block and go on with fulfilling the auction even if the transfer isn't successful, the collateral may be claimed later by other means.
