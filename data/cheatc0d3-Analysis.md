# Security Analysis Report for the Ethereum Credit Guild

## Introduction

The Ethereum Credit Guild (ECG) is a decentralized lending protocol that aims to provide censorship-resistant savings and credit without reliance on trusted oracles or centralized governance. It uses novel mechanisms like pessimistic accounting, bad debt markdowns, and liquidity auctions to improve upon existing models.

This report analyzes the security of the ECG protocol based on available design documentation. It examines issues, architecture, code quality, risks, and core mechanisms.

## Known Issues

The ECG documentation discloses several known issues:

- Pessimistic accounting can cause lags in interest distribution
- Some contracts violate Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern 
- Governance quorums enable gridlock scenarios
- Profit distribution rounding errors  
- Rate-limited minting creates bottlenecks
- Gaming vulnerabilities around liquidations

## Architecture Recommendations

To mitigate risks, the following architectural changes are advised:

- Use an optimistic accounting model
- Ensure all contracts follow CEI best practices
- Introduce emergency mechanisms to prevent governance gridlock
- Fix rounding errors in rebasing distributions 
- Build a recovery process for unclaimable collateral tokens
- Adjust the rate-limited minter to handle credit multiplier

## Codebase Quality Analysis

The ECG codebase exhibits well-structured, modular contract design with a clear separation of concerns. Extensive use of inheritance indicates code reuse and adherence to security best practices via OpenZeppelin.

The documentation is thorough and provides clarity into the intended behavior of complex rebasing distributions and liquidity auctions.

## Centralization Risks  

The protocol has considerable centralization risks stemming from the GOVERNOR and GUARDIAN administrator roles which hold unilateral control. The contracts are also highly interconnected, creating single points of failure.

Transitioning to decentralized governance and compartmentalizing contracts would reduce these issues.

## Mechanism Review

Core mechanisms around collateral auctions and bad debt handling appear well-considered but have complex behaviors that warrant extensive testing and simulation. Formal verification is highly recommended where possible.

The lack of reliance on external oracles is a strength from a security standpoint. But intricacies in accounting flows pose audit challenges.

## Systemic Risks

Due to reliance on external ERC20 tokens as collateral assets, the protocol inherits risks from potential failures in those networks. Interdependencies between lending terms can also create contagion risk.

Governance gridlock scenarios could impede emergency response during market volatility or black swan events outside the protocol's control.

## Conclusion

The ECG protocol shows promise in progressing lending models to align with crypto principles. But issues exist around centralization, complexity, and systemic risks that should be addressed.
