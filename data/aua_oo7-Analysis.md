core/Core.sol
•  Gas Efficiency: The current implementation sets up the initial roles in the constructor. While this is acceptable for deployment, it could lead to high gas costs if the hierarchy is extensive. Consider using a separate function to set up roles after deployment, allowing for more gas-efficient deployments.
•  Constants and Magic Values: The contract contains hardcoded role names such as CoreRoles.GOVERNOR. It's good practice to define these as constants at the contract level to enhance code readability and maintenance. This can also help prevent errors if the role names need to be updated in the future.
solidity
•  bytes32 public constant GOVERNOR_ROLE = CoreRoles.GOVERNOR;
Then use GOVERNOR_ROLE instead of CoreRoles.GOVERNOR throughout the code.
•  Comments: While the code is generally well-commented, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the onlyRole modifier, as it's referenced in the createRole function but not defined in the provided code.
•  Modifier Name Clarity: The onlyRole modifier is used in the createRole function, but the modifier itself is not shown in the provided code snippet. Ensure that the modifier name reflects its purpose to enhance code readability.
•  Event Logging: Consider adding events to log important state changes, such as when a new role is created. Event logging can be helpful for debugging and monitoring contract interactions.
solidity
•  event RoleCreated(bytes32 indexed role, bytes32 indexed adminRole);
Emit this event in the createRole function after calling _setRoleAdmin.
•  Fallback Function: Consider adding a fallback function with the payable modifier to handle Ether sent to the contract accidentally. This can prevent Ether from being trapped in the contract unintentionally.
solidity
receive() external payable {
    // Handle incoming Ether or reject it
}

Strong Points:
1.	Role-Based Access Control: The contract follows a role-based access control approach by using the "governor-only" modifier in functions like setMintRatio and setRewardRatio. This ensures that only authorized entities with the GOVERNOR role can modify critical parameters, enhancing security and control.
2.	Events for Transparency: The contract emits events (Stake, Unstake, GuildReward, MintRatioUpdate, RewardRatioUpdate) to log important state changes. This improves transparency and allows external systems to track activities on the contract.
3.	SafeCastLib Usage: The contract uses SafeCastLib for safe casting, which helps prevent overflow and underflow issues when performing arithmetic operations with different data types.
4.	Modular Design: The contract imports functionalities from external contracts, promoting a modular and organized design. This can make the code easier to understand, maintain, and upgrade.
5.	Reentrancy Protection: The contract utilizes the "updateState" pattern to protect against reentrancy issues when interacting with external contracts and updating internal state. This can prevent potential vulnerabilities related to reentrancy attacks.
6.	Consistent Naming Conventions: The code follows consistent naming conventions, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose and usage of variables and functions.
7.	Comments and Documentation: The code includes comments explaining the purpose of functions, the flow of the contract, and key variables. This documentation aids developers in understanding the contract's logic and functionality.
Weak Points:
1.	Gas Limit Considerations: The getRewards function can potentially consume a significant amount of gas, especially if there are many users with pending rewards. Consider gas optimization strategies or potential gas limit issues during large-scale operations.
2.	Potential for External Contract Dependency Risks: The contract relies on external contracts (ProfitManager, CreditToken, GuildToken, RateLimitedMinter). Ensure that these contracts are well-audited and trustworthy, as their security directly affects the overall security of this contract.
3.	Unrestricted Use of transfer Function: The contract uses the transfer function to transfer CREDIT tokens and GUILD tokens. Ensure that these transfers are safe and do not result in reentrancy vulnerabilities. Consider using the SafeERC20 library for additional safety.
4.	Missing Overflow Protection in updateMintRatio: The updateMintRatio function lacks explicit overflow protection when calculating guildAfter. Consider adding overflow checks to prevent potential issues.
5.	Lack of Deadline for Unstake: The unstake function does not include a deadline parameter, which might expose the contract to front-running or other issues. Consider adding a deadline parameter to protect users during the unstaking process.
6.	Complex Logic in getRewards: The getRewards function contains complex logic, and the flow might be challenging to follow. Consider refactoring or adding more comments to enhance readability and understanding.
7.	Potential for Slashing Without User Notification: If a user is slashed, the contract updates the state without emitting an Unstake event, which might impact external systems relying on event logs for user actions. Consider emitting an event even when a user is slashed.
