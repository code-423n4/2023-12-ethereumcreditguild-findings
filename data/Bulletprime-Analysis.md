1.1 Ethereum Credit Guild Overview
The Ethereum Credit Guild, formerly known as Volt Protocol, is a protocol for trust-minimized pooled lending on the Ethereum network. It aims to create a credibly neutral and censorship-resistant savings and credit system. The protocol has evolved to unify all minting within a CDP/debt issuance model with ephemeral loan terms that do not rely on an external trusted oracle. This means that automated systems for borrowing or liquidating must exist on top of this neutral base layer. The majority of lending on Ethereum is pool-to-peer, where a large number of lenders deposit assets into a pool whose parameters are governed by a set of token holders, with price updates provided by a trusted oracle, and individual borrowers provide collateral and borrow from the pool at their discretion. Even liquid staking protocols can be viewed as lending pools, since they borrow ETH from depositors and lend it to operators who may or may not post collateral, as well as setting the interest rate paid by borrowers to lenders, and taking a margin.

1.2 Some Core contraccts and workflow 

`LendingTermOffboarding` It provides a mechanism to offboard a LendingTerm, which is a key feature of the protocol. The offboarding process is designed to be reactive, meaning that polls should not stay open for a long time.

The contract maintains several mappings to keep track of the offboarding process. For example, the polls mapping stores the quorum supporting the removal of a LendingTerm for each snapshot block. The userPollVotes mapping keeps track of the votes cast by users in removal polls.

The contract also emits several events to notify the system of important changes. For example, `the OffboardSupport` event is emitted when a user supports the removal of a LendingTerm. The Offboard event is emitted when a LendingTerm is offboarded, and the Cleanup event is emitted when a LendingTerm is cleaned up.

The contract provides functions to propose the offboarding of a LendingTerm, support a poll to offboard a LendingTerm, and actually offboard and clean up a LendingTerm. These functions are designed to be called by authorized users and provide the necessary checks and updates to ensure the integrity of the offboarding process.

1.2.2 The `LendingTermOnboarding`
Factory for creating LendingTerm instances and manages the lifecycle of these instances.
Constructor: The constructor initializes the contract with various parameters including references to the GuildToken, profit manager, auction house, credit minter, and credit token. It also sets the gauge type and the minimum delay between proposals.

Allowing Implementations: The `allowImplementation` function allows or disallows a given implementation. This function can only be called by the `Governor role`.

Creating a Term: The `createTerm`function creates a new `LendingTerm` instance and initializes it. It first checks if the implementation is allowed, then verifies the parameters passed to it. If everything is valid, it clones the implementation and initializes it with the provided parameters.

Proposing Onboarding: The `proposeOnboard` function is used to propose the onboarding of a term. It checks if the term has been created by this factory, if it hasn't been proposed recently, and if it isn't already active. If all these conditions are met, it generates the calldata for the proposal and calls the `propose` function of the Governor contract.

Generating Calldata for Onboarding: The `getOnboardProposeArgs` function generates the calldata for the onboarding of a term. It prepares three calls: one to add the term as a gauge to the GuildToken, and two to grant roles to the term in the Core contract.
Overriding the `Propose` Function: The propose function is overridden to prevent arbitrary calls from being proposed. Any attempt to call this function will result in a revert.

1.2.3 
The `ProfitManager` contract manages profits generated in the system and how it is distributed among stakeholders. It also manages a surplus buffer, which acts as first-loss capital in case of bad debt. Here is a detailed workflow of this contract:

Initialization: The `initializeReferences` function is used to initialize references to the GUILD, CREDIT, and PSM tokens. This function can only be called by the Governor role.

Setting Parameters: The `setMinBorrow` and `setGaugeWeightTolerance` functions are used to set the minimum borrow amount and the gauge weight tolerance. Both functions can only be called by the Governor role.

Donating to Surplus Buffer: The `donateToSurplusBuffer` and donateToTermSurplusBuffer functions are used to donate to the surplus buffer and term surplus buffer respectively. These functions update the surplus buffers and emit events indicating the update.

Withdrawing from Surplus Buffer: The `withdrawFromSurplusBuffer` and withdrawFromTermSurplusBuffer functions are used to withdraw from the surplus buffer and term surplus buffer respectively. These functions update the surplus buffers, transfer the withdrawn amount to the specified address, and emit events indicating the update.

Notifying Profit and Loss: The `notifyPnL` function is used to notify profit and loss in a given gauge. If the amount is positive, it distributes the profit to the surplus buffer, other recipients, lenders, and the guild. If the amount is negative, it handles the loss by depleting the surplus buffer and updating the CREDIT multiplier.

Claiming Rewards: The `claimGaugeRewards` and claimRewards functions are used to claim a user's rewards for a given gauge and across all their active gauges respectively. These functions calculate the credit earned and transfer it to the user.

Getting Pending Rewards: The `getPendingRewards` function is used to read and return pending undistributed rewards for a given user.

1.2.4 
The `ERC20Gauges` contract for managing a voting system with a "gauge" style, where holders can allocate weight in any proportion to supported gauges.
Gauge State: The contract maintains a state of gauges, which are represented by addresses. Each gauge has a weight associated with it, representing the amount of influence it has in the voting system. Gauges can be deprecated and reinstated, preserving their weight in case they are re-added.

User Gauge Weights: The contract keeps track of the weight allocated by each user to each gauge. This is stored in the `getUserGaugeWeight` mapping.

Total Weight: The contract maintains a total weight of all live gauges. This is used to calculate the proportion of resources to be allocated to each gauge.

User Operations: Users can increment or decrement the weight of a gauge, effectively increasing or reducing their influence in the voting system. When a user increments or decrements a gauge, the corresponding gauge weight and user weight are updated accordingly.

Admin Operations: Admins can add or remove gauges. Adding a gauge involves adding it to the `_gauges` set and setting its type. Removing a gauge involves moving it from the _gauges set to the `_deprecatedGauges` set.

Token Transfers: When a user transfers tokens, the contract decreases the user's weight until they are under weight. This ensures that the user's weight does not exceed their token balance.

Reentrancy Protection: The contract uses the `_decrementWeightUntilFree` function to free up weight before a token burn/transfer. This is a greedy algorithm that frees up entire gauges, so it is likely to free more than the required weight.


 Codebase Approach 
 Consistently following my pattern that has proven to detect low hanging fruits in terms of exposing vulnerabilities.
2.1 Audit Documentation and Scope

Initial step involved, was thoroughly examining `audit documentation and scope` to grasp the audit’s functionalities and boundaries, so as to priorities my efforts. It is worth highlighting the good quality of the `README` for this audit, as it provided valuable insights and actionable guidance that greatly facilitated the onboarding process.

2.2 General insight on lending Functionality

A good amount of hour was put in gaining knowledge on how conventional lending pools, as the contracts code is basically an improved form of options trade, this helped me understand fully the problem the protocol is trying to solve, the gap its trying to bridge, their goals and how the methods implemented not just work, but to what degree better than the conventional.

2.3 Setup and Testing

Setting up test environment to execute forge test, though asked more questions and found ways to still further  test as it greatly enhanced the efficiency of the auditing process. With a fully functional test tap at my disposal, which not only accelerate the testing of intricate concepts and potential vulnerabilities but i also gain insights into the developer’s expectations regarding all implementations. 

2.4 Code review

The code review commenced with understanding the pattern” used to manage governance and functionality accross the system. Thoroughly understanding this pattern made understanding the protocol contracts and its relations much smoother. Throughout this stage, I documented observations and raised questions concerning potential exploits without going too deep while uncovering the codes intent.

2.5 Threat Modelling

At this point I began formulating specific assumptions that, if compromised, could pose security risks to the system. This process aids me in determining the most effective exploitation strategies. Thoroughly examining and marking any doubtful or vulnerable areas within the protocol, diving deep into these areas, performing in-depth examinations, and subjecting them to rigorous testing to report these issues if they dont checkout.

2.6 Known Finding 
Read old audits and already known findings. Went through the bot races findings checking what was found so as to not report these issues again, while bearing in mind invariants and critial parts of functions that can lead to users lossing funds.

2.7 Report Issues
I started with auditing the code base indepthly this way I started understanding line by line code and took the necessary notes to ask questions, marking out vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited, This assessment helps in evaluating whether these exploits can be strategically combined to create a more significant impact on the system’s security. In some cases, seemingly minor and moderate issues can compound to form a critical vulnerability when leveraged wisely. This has to be balanced with any risks that users may face.

3.0 Architecture & Recommendations
The architecture of the project seems to follow good practices. They are modular, with clear separation of concerns and trust zones. Each contract has a specific responsibility and interacts with others through well-defined interfaces. The use of inheritance and composition to reuse and extend code is commendable.
Access Control: In the `LendingTermOnboarding` contract, the `allowImplementation` function allows or disallows a given implementation. This function can only be called by the Governor role. However, it's not clear who exactly can assume the Governor role. The contract should clearly define who can assign the Governor role to ensure the correct operation of the contract.
Error Handling: The createTerm function in the `LendingTermOnboarding` contract uses require statements to validate inputs. However, the error messages associated with these require statements are quite generic and do not provide specific details about what caused the failure. More descriptive error messages would make debugging easier.
Documentation: The contracts lack extensive comments explaining the purpose and behavior of each function. Good documentation makes the contract easier to understand and maintain.
Deployment Scripts: There's no mention of deployment scripts in the provided contracts. Always prepare deployment scripts regardless of the contract size. This can help ensure that the contract is deployed correctly and consistently.
Common Mistakes in Business Logic: The contracts seem to be free of obvious common mistakes in business logic. However, it's always worth revisiting the logic to ensure it's correct and secure.
Remember, developing smart contracts requires precision and meticulousness. Following these recommendations can help ensure that your contracts are secure, maintainable, and effective.

4.0 Code Commentary 
Code quality and documentation is very mature. The test suite is pretty comprehensive and fuzz tests are a great way to complement the static tests. Coverage test really did cover a great line but having a good test coverage doesn't always mean the project is bug free so the need for manual audits by wardens is also always a good suggestion in helping to secure projects and improving code quality. 
Modular Design: The contracts are modular, with clear separation of concerns. Each contract has a specific responsibility and interacts with others through well-defined interfaces. This design pattern enhances readability and maintainability.
Use of Inheritance and Composition: The contracts use inheritance and composition to reuse and extend code. This is a good practice as it reduces code duplication and enhances code organization.
Good Error Handling: The contracts use require statements for input validation, which is a good practice. However, the error messages associated with these require statements are quite generic and do not provide specific details about what caused the failure. More descriptive error messages would make debugging easier. The contracts lack extensive comments explaining the purpose and behavior of each function. Good documentation makes the contract easier to understand and maintain.

5.0 Centralization Risk 
This can occur when certain functions are not properly secured with access controls, allowing only a select few to execute them. Such functions could potentially be used to manipulate the contract's state or drain funds, leading to a centralized control over the contract. There are several places where centralization risk could potentially arise, 
Owner Role: In the LendingTermOnboarding contract, the `allowImplementation` function can only be called by the Governor role. However, it's not clear who exactly can assume the Governor role. If the Governor role is assigned to a single account, this could introduce centralization risk. The contract should clearly define who can assign the Governor role to ensure the correct operation of the contract.
Admin Functions: The `initializeReferences` function in the `ProfitManager` contract can only be called by the Governor role. Again, it's not clear who exactly can assume the Governor role. If the Governor role is assigned to a single account, this could introduce centralization risk.
Permission Verification: As stated, critically, mitigating the known vulnerability of missing permission verification by implementing authorization patterns can in turn introduce centralization. The contracts do not seem to implement explicit permission verification, which could potentially be exploited to introduce centralization.
To mitigate centralization risk, it's recommended to:
Clearly define who can assign the Governor role in the `LendingTermOnboarding` contract.
Implement explicit permission verification in the contracts.
Regularly audit the contracts to identify and fix potential centralization vulnerabilities.
Use of static analysis tools to detect patterns in the contracts that contribute to centralization risk.
As also seen from the bot race where the project is at a position of centralization risk, covering lapse and fixing up would further strengthen this project. 

6.0 Systemic/ Mechanism risk 
Systemic and Mechanism risks refer to the potential flaws in the system design or operational procedures that could impact the entire system or individual components. These risks can stem from complex interactions between different parts of the system, or from the way certain mechanisms are implemented. Systemic and mechanism risks, along with possible mitigations:
Interactions Between Contracts: The `LendingTermOnboarding` and `ProfitManager` contracts interact with each other. If there's a bug or a flaw in either contract, it could affect the other. To mitigate this risk, thoroughly test both contracts individually and together to ensure they work as expected. Additionally, consider using formal methods or model checking to verify the correctness of the interaction between contracts.
Complex Operational Procedures: The `notifyPnL` function in the `ProfitManager` contract has complex operational procedures. If there's a bug in this function, it could potentially lead to incorrect profit and loss calculations, which could in turn affect the entire system. To mitigate this risk, thoroughly test the `notifyPnL` function to ensure it works as expected. Additionally, consider using formal methods or model checking to verify the correctness of this function.
Access Control Risks: As mentioned earlier, the contracts have defined access control mechanisms, such as the Governor role in the `LendingTermOnboarding` contract. However, if the Governor role is assigned to a single account, this could introduce centralization risk and potentially lead to systemic risks. To mitigate this risk, carefully manage who can assume the Governor role and regularly audit the contracts to ensure proper access control.
Event Emissions: The contracts emit events for significant actions. However, relying solely on events for critical operations can lead to systemic risks if the events are not properly monitored or if the contract fails to emit events. To mitigate this risk, ensure that critical operations are not solely dependent on events and that events are properly monitored.
while the provided contracts demonstrate good design principles and follow good practices, it's essential to thoroughly test them, consider formal methods for verification, and carefully manage access control to mitigate systemic and mechanism risks.

The provided contracts demonstrate a good understanding of smart contract development best practices, including modular design, use of inheritance and composition, and access control mechanisms. They also exhibit a focus on error handling and input validation, which are key aspects of secure smart contract development, and that i must commend.
