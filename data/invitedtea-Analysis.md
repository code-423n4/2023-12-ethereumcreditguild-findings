# 3. Centralization Risks

In the Ethereum Credit Guild (ECG), similar to the `Ethena` Protocol example, the system assigns critical roles and responsibilities to specific entities, which introduces potential centralization risks. These roles, while necessary for the protocol's functionality, can become points of vulnerability if compromised.

### Key Centralization Risks in ECG:

- **Role Compromise**: Important roles like `CREDIT_MINTER`, `GUARDIAN`, and `GOVERNOR` hold substantial power over the protocol's operations. A compromised role, especially a `CREDIT_MINTER`, could lead to unauthorized minting of tokens, potentially destabilizing the ecosystem.
- **Single Points of Failure**: Roles like `GAUGE_PARAMETERS` or `RATE_LIMITED_GUILD_MINTER` could become single points of failure if their control is centralized, leading to potential manipulation or mismanagement.

### Mitigation Strategies in ECG:

- **Limitations on Minting and Redeeming**: ECG could implement on-chain limits for critical actions like minting or redeeming tokens. For instance, setting a cap per transaction or per block can significantly reduce the impact of a compromised role.
- **Decentralized Gatekeepers**: Introducing roles like `GATEKEEPERS`, which can intervene in suspicious activities, adds a layer of security. These roles should be distributed across different entities to avoid centralization.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Implementing automated systems that monitor transactions and trigger alerts or actions when anomalies are detected can further secure the protocol.
- **Multi-Signature Controls**: For critical actions, requiring multi-signature approval can reduce the risk of a single compromised account causing significant damage.

### Summary:

While the Ethereum Credit Guild introduces several centralization risks due to the allocation of significant powers to certain roles, the implementation of effective mitigation strategies can minimize these risks. These include setting transaction limits, dece

# 4. Systemic Risks

Here’s an analysis of potential systemic risks for the Ethereum Credit Guild:

1. **Smart Contract Vulnerability Risk**:
   - Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit. Critical security flaws, such as logic issues or improper access controls, could lead to asset loss or system manipulation.
   - It is essential that the Ethereum Credit Guild undergoes thorough audits. Any issues identified, especially by reputable entities such as C4 Wardens, must be promptly addressed and mitigated.

###

2. **Third-Party Dependency Risk**:
   - The Ethereum Credit Guild's contracts rely on external libraries and data sources, such as OpenZeppelin contracts. There is an inherent risk that issues found in these dependencies could adversely impact the guild's protocol.
   - It's crucial to ensure that all third-party dependencies are regularly updated to their latest versions to mitigate this risk. For instance, if the guild uses OpenZeppelin libraries, they should be consistently kept up-to-date:

   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable": "latest_version"
   }

# 5. Attack Vectors During the Audit

The Ethereum Credit Guild, like any complex smart contract system, is susceptible to various attack vectors. During the audit process, particular attention should be paid to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Issues related to Roles (Centralization Risks)**:
   - The assignment and management of roles, such as `CREDIT_MINTER` or `GUARDIAN`, are critical. Improper handling or changing of these roles can introduce centralization risks and potential for misuse.

2. **Breaking of Main Protocol Invariants**:
   - Contracts like `ProfitManager.sol` or `GuildToken.sol` must adhere strictly to their intended logic. Any deviation from expected behavior could compromise the system's integrity. For example, tokens should only be minted or burned under defined conditions.

3. **DoS for Important Protocol Functions/Flows**:
   - Functions critical to the protocol, such as minting, redeeming, or staking, must be resilient to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. It's crucial to ensure that contracts like `AuctionHouse.sol` or `SimplePSM.sol` can't be easily disrupted.

4. **Token Transfer Fails**:
   - Token transfer failures, either due to smart contract errors or ERC20 token compliance issues, could significantly disrupt the protocol's operations.

5. **Minting More Than Prescribed Limits Per Block**:
   - If the protocol imposes a minting limit per block (e.g., 100k tokens), it's essential to enforce this strictly to prevent excessive token generation.

6. **Challenges in Unstaking/Withdrawing/Redeeming**:
   - Ensure that users can always unstake, withdraw, or redeem their assets without unintended hindrances or bugs.

7. **Unauthorized Withdrawals**:
   - The system must be secure against scenarios where users could withdraw more assets than they are entitled to, leading to asset depletion.

8. **Minting Without Adequate Collateral**:
   - The minting process, potentially governed by contracts like `LendingTerm.sol`, should always require the appropriate collateral. Minting without or with insufficient collateral could severely undermine the token's value and trust.

By addressing these attack vectors, the Ethereum Credit Guild can enhance its security and robustness, ensuring a more secure and stable platform for its users.
