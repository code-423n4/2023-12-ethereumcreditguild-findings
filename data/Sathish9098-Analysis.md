# Ethereum Credit Guild Analysis

## Overview
The Ethereum Credit Guild is a DeFi protocol featuring a dual-token system: GUILD for governance and gUSDC as a debt token.

``Smart Contracts``: Utilizes contracts like LendingTerm for loan conditions, and AuctionHouse for asset liquidation.

``Gauge Voting System``: Allows GUILD holders to vote on credit limits and loan terms, aligning governance with financial outcomes.

``Token Mechanics``: GUILD tokens are minted via staking gUSDC, with functionalities centered around protocol governance.

``Risk and Debt Management``: Implements strategies for managing bad debt and liquidation, adjustable through governance votes.

``Decentralized Governance``: Employs a governance model allowing token holders to make key protocol decisions, ensuring community-driven management.

## Project’s Risk Model

## Systemic risks

### gUSDC Value Fluctuations and the Lending Mechanism

- gUSDC, being pegged to USDC, should ideally maintain a stable value. However, if its value deviates significantly from USDC (due to market dynamics, liquidity issues, or rebasing mechanics), this could impact the borrowing and lending operations.
- The protocol’s reliance on gUSDC for lending activities means that fluctuations in its value could affect the loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. A decrease in gUSDC value might result in loans becoming under-collateralized, triggering liquidations.

### GUILD Tokens and Gauge Voting

- GUILD tokens are used for governance decisions, including voting on LendingTerms. Significant changes in the GUILD value could influence voter behavior, potentially skewing decision-making towards short-term gains rather than long-term protocol health.
- If GUILD's value increases significantly, it might attract speculative voting behavior, while a decrease in value could lead to apathy or reduced participation among stakeholders.

### Rebasing and gUSDC Stability

- The ERC20RebaseDistributor mechanism might be involved in maintaining gUSDC’s peg to USDC. If rebasing is not accurately aligned with market conditions, it could lead to either inflationary or deflationary pressures on gUSDC.
- Inaccurate rebasing can affect users' trust in gUSDC's stability, which is crucial for its function as a credit token.

### Collateral Auction Dynamics in AuctionHouse

- The AuctionHouse contract presumably handles liquidations of collateral. Fluctuations in gUSDC or the collateral’s value could impact the efficacy of these auctions.
- In a scenario where gUSDC’s value drops, the proceeds from liquidation auctions might not cover the outstanding loans, leading to bad debt.

### Impact on Credit Ceiling and Lending Terms

- Changes in gUSDC value could necessitate adjustments in global debt ceilings and other parameters within LendingTerms to manage the protocol's overall risk exposure.
- If gUSDC devalues, the protocol might need to reduce its debt ceiling to maintain a healthy collateralization ratio across its loan portfolio.

### Minting and Staking Dynamics:

The mechanism for staking gUSDC to mint GUILD, and the reverse process, might be influenced by the changing values of these tokens. A decline in GUILD's value, for instance, could reduce the incentive for users to stake gUSDC.

### Interactions with External Factors:
Given that gUSDC is pegged to USDC, external factors affecting USDC (like regulatory changes or issuer solvency) could indirectly impact gUSDC's stability and, by extension, the entire Ethereum Credit Guild ecosystem.

## Technical risks

### ERC20RebaseDistributor

``Precision and Rounding Errors``: Complex rebasing calculations could lead to precision loss or rounding errors, affecting token balances.
``Rebasing Side Effects``: Unintended side effects of rebasing on user balances, particularly if user interactions occur during the rebasing process.

### AuctionHouse

``Liquidation Logic Flaws``: Errors in implementing the liquidation logic could lead to inefficient or incorrect asset liquidation.
``Smart Contract Interactions``: Vulnerabilities in how AuctionHouse interacts with other contracts, like token contracts or external DeFi platforms.

### LendingTerm

``Loan Parameters Handling``: Inaccuracies in setting or modifying loan parameters (interest rates, collateral ratios) could affect lending operations.
``Loan Lifecycle Management``: Bugs in the management of loan states (active, defaulted, liquidated) could result in incorrect system behavior.

### General Technical Risks

``Parameter Adjustment Vulnerabilities``: Mismanagement or errors in adjusting critical protocol parameters could destabilize the system.

``Reentrancy Attacks``: Functions that transfer funds or interact with external contracts could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

``Gas Limitations and Inefficiencies``: Functions, particularly those with complex logic, might consume excessive gas, leading to high transaction costs or failures.

``Inter-Contract Dependency Risks``: Given the interconnected nature of the contracts, a bug or failure in one contract (e.g., ERC20RebaseDistributor) could adversely affect others (like LendingTerm).

``Front-Running in AuctionHouse``: Potential for front-running in auction bids, where miners or other users could exploit the transaction ordering for their benefit.

## Integration risks

``Inter-Contract Financial Calculations``: Any financial calculations in other contracts (like yield farming rewards, fee distributions, etc.) relying on token balances might yield incorrect results post-rebase.

``Consistency in Asset Valuation`` : The value of assets transferred during the auction needs to be consistent with their valuation in other parts of the system. Discrepancies here can affect the protocol's financial accuracy.

``Collateralization and Loan Agreements``: In lending scenarios, where the rebased token might be used as collateral, changes in token quantity could affect collateralization ratios. This might inadvertently trigger liquidations or alter loan terms.

``Liquidity Pools and DeFi Protocols``: If the rebased token is used in liquidity pools or other DeFi protocols, a rebase event can change the value or quantity of tokens in these pools. This could lead to issues like imbalanced pools, affecting staking, lending, or swapping operations.

``Rebase Impact on Other Contracts``
The rebasing mechanism could have unintended impacts on contracts that interact with the rebased token. For example, if other contracts are not designed to handle rebasing tokens correctly, users’ balances or contract states might become inconsistent after a rebase event.

``Governance Decisions Propagation``: Decisions made through the governance process, particularly by the GOVERNOR, might involve changes in multiple contracts. Ensuring that these changes are synchronized and do not create conflicts or inconsistencies is a significant integration concern.

``Role Changes and Access Control``: Adjustments in roles or permissions must be propagated correctly across all affected contracts to avoid access control breaches or functional discrepancies.

``Data Synchronization``: Ensuring that all relevant contracts have up-to-date and synchronized information regarding loan terms, active loans, and borrower details is crucial.


## Admin abuse risks

#### Roles

```solidity

        // Initial roles setup: direct hierarchy, everything under governor
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.GOVERNOR, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.GUARDIAN, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.CREDIT_MINTER, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.RATE_LIMITED_CREDIT_MINTER, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.GUILD_MINTER, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.RATE_LIMITED_GUILD_MINTER, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.GAUGE_ADD, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.GAUGE_REMOVE, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.GAUGE_PARAMETERS, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.GAUGE_PNL_NOTIFIER, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(
            CoreRoles.GUILD_GOVERNANCE_PARAMETERS,
            CoreRoles.GOVERNOR
        );
        _setRoleAdmin(
            CoreRoles.GUILD_SURPLUS_BUFFER_WITHDRAW,
            CoreRoles.GOVERNOR
        );
        _setRoleAdmin(
            CoreRoles.CREDIT_GOVERNANCE_PARAMETERS,
            CoreRoles.GOVERNOR
        );
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.CREDIT_REBASE_PARAMETERS, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.TIMELOCK_PROPOSER, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.TIMELOCK_EXECUTOR, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);
        _setRoleAdmin(CoreRoles.TIMELOCK_CANCELLER, CoreRoles.GOVERNOR);

```
Sets up a role-based access control system in a Ethereum Credit Guild, with a strong centralization of power under the GOVERNOR role

#### Risk of Admin Abuse

- The ``GOVERNOR`` has administrative power over all roles, potentially leading to a single point of control and decision-making. This centralization can be efficient for management but poses risks of abuse or mismanagement.

- Centralization of control makes the system vulnerable to the decisions or actions of the GOVERNOR. If the GOVERNOR acts maliciously or is compromised, the entire protocol could be at risk.

- With the GOVERNOR controlling all key roles, including those related to minting tokens (CREDIT_MINTER, GUILD_MINTER), managing gauges (GAUGE_ADD, GAUGE_REMOVE, GAUGE_PARAMETERS), and executing time-locked transactions (TIMELOCK_PROPOSER, TIMELOCK_EXECUTOR, TIMELOCK_CANCELLER), there's a risk that this power could be used in ways that are not in the best interest of the protocol or its users.

#### Future Scalability and Adaptability

``Challenges in Protocol Evolution``: As the protocol grows and evolves, the centralized GOVERNOR structure might become a bottleneck, hindering the adoption of changes and updates that require a broader consensus.

``Potential for Governance Gridlock`` : Over time, the concentration of power might lead to governance gridlock if the GOVERNOR becomes resistant to changes or if there’s a conflict of interest within the community.

## Architecture assessment of business logic

I analyzed the architecture and business logic of abstract contract ``ERC20RebaseDistributor`` and two important contracts: ``AuctionHouse`` and ``LendingTerm``. This analysis focuses on their structures and operational mechanics.

### ERC20RebaseDistributor Contract

#### Architecture

![ERC20RebaseDistributor](https://gist.github.com/assets/58845085/906c9cea-c326-4dcf-9445-42285e7a30be)

The ERC20RebaseDistributor contract, designed for a rebase mechanism in a DeFi protocol, exhibits several key implementations,

``Rebase Functionality``: It allows token supply adjustments (rebasing), proportionally affecting the balance of all token holders who opt into rebasing.

``Opt-in Mechanism``: Users can choose to participate in rebasing through enterRebase() and opt out using exitRebase(), providing flexibility in how they wish to interact with the token's economics.

``Token Burn for Distribution``: The contract enables users to burn their tokens to distribute value to all rebasing token holders, enhancing the token's utility as a distribution mechanism.

``Share-Based Accounting``: Internally, the contract converts user balances to shares when they opt into rebasing. This approach simplifies the calculation of individual holdings post-rebase.

``Dynamic Share Price Calculation``: The share price is recalculated upon each distribution, ensuring that the value of rebasing shares accurately reflects the new total supply.

``Interpolation for Distribution``: The contract uses a linear interpolation over a set period (30 days) to gradually distribute the value of burned tokens, preventing sudden supply shocks.

``Safeguards Against Manipulation``: The contract highlights the need for a meaningful initial balance in rebasing to prevent share price manipulation, echoing concerns from historical DeFi exploits.

### AuctionHouse Contract

#### Architecture

![ActionHouse](https://gist.github.com/assets/58845085/e7dff48e-1ad6-47c0-bb55-6f0bf510754f)

#### AuctionHouse Intraction Flow

![AuctionHouse](https://gist.github.com/assets/58845085/8f61b2ff-6c35-4e47-bac8-48126883fde7)

![AuctionHouseIntraction](https://gist.github.com/assets/58845085/adde9417-a15f-499c-a345-bc58c2685b12)

The AuctionHouse contract in a DeFi protocol typically manages the auctioning of assets, often used for liquidating collateral from defaulted loans or for other decentralized governance purposes. It allows users to place bids on assets, handles the logic for determining winning bids, and ensures the transfer of both assets and payment according to the auction rules. The contract is designed to be transparent, fair, and efficient, providing a decentralized mechanism for asset liquidation or sales within the ecosystem

### LendingTerm Contract

#### Architecture

![LendingTerm1](https://gist.github.com/assets/58845085/aa5a454b-dba4-4977-a632-095fa65e1b54)

#### LendingTerm Intraction Flow

![LendingTerm](https://gist.github.com/assets/58845085/b90b6079-6f1b-4d0e-88ae-db3aee2c5665)

The LendingTerm contract in a DeFi protocol is designed to define and manage the terms of lending operations.

``Setting Loan Parameters``: It specifies the conditions for loans, such as interest rates, collateral requirements, maximum debt per collateral, and repayment schedules.

``Loan Origination``: Facilitates the creation of new loans under the specified terms, handling collateralization and issuance of debt.

``Repayment and Liquidation``: Manages loan repayments and enforces liquidation in case of defaults, ensuring compliance with the set terms.

``Governance Integration``: Often integrated with governance mechanisms for modifying terms or adding new ones, reflecting the decentralized decision-making process.

### 100% Coverage:

Files like Core.sol, CoreRef.sol, LendingTermOnboarding.sol, and several others show 100% coverage across lines, statements, branches, and functions. This indicates that every line of code, every conditional branch, and every function in these files have been executed during testing, which is ideal.

### Less Than 100% Coverage:

Files such as GuildGovernor.sol, GuildVetoGovernor.sol, and LendingTerm.sol have less than 100% coverage in some areas. This could be a cause for concern, especially in a DeFi protocol, where untested code might lead to vulnerabilities or unexpected behaviors.
The test/forge-std/... files have significantly lower coverage. These might be standard test utilities or mock contracts used for testing other components. While lower coverage here might be less critical, it's still worth investigating if it impacts the reliability of the tests.

### Impact of Non-100% Coverage:

``Security Risks``: In DeFi, untested code could lead to security vulnerabilities, potentially leading to loss of funds or other exploits.
``Functional Bugs``: Lack of coverage might mean that certain edge cases or error conditions are not tested, which could result in bugs or unexpected behavior in production.
``Integration Issues``: In a protocol with multiple interacting contracts, untested code in one contract might cause issues in another, especially in complex transactions or state changes.

## Software engineering considerations

### Purpose-Specific Modules
Design contracts like ERC20RebaseDistributor, AuctionHouse, and LendingTerm as modular components. This allows for easier upgrades and maintenance.

### Separation of Concerns
Ensure each contract focuses on a specific functionality, reducing complexity and potential for bugs.

### Unit Testing
Develop comprehensive unit tests for each function in the contracts, covering all possible edge cases.

### Stress Testing and Simulation
Perform stress tests simulating extreme market conditions to evaluate the contracts' resilience.

### Mathematical Proofs
Use formal verification tools to prove the correctness of critical functions, especially those in ERC20RebaseDistributor involving complex mathematical calculations.

### State Invariants
Establish and verify state invariants for contracts to ensure they maintain consistent states throughout transactions.

### Reentrancy Guards
Implement checks against reentrancy attacks, particularly in functions that interact externally in AuctionHouse.

### Optimize for Gas
Refactor contract code to minimize gas consumption, crucial for functions likely to be called frequently.

### Proxy Patterns
If upgradeability is a requirement, consider using proxy patterns, ensuring a clear separation between data and logic.

### Version Control
Maintain strict version control and changelogs for all contracts to track changes and upgrades over time.

### Transparent Governance Processes
Develop and maintain clear, transparent processes for governance actions, documented in code comments and developer documentation.

### Smart Contract Events
Emit detailed events in contracts for better off-chain tracking and to facilitate user interface updates.

### Comprehensive Documentation
Maintain detailed documentation for each contract, describing its purpose, functions, and interaction mechanisms.


## Code Weakspots 

### Complex Rebasing Logic in _balance2shares and _shares2balance Functions

```solidity

function _balance2shares(uint256 balance, uint256 sharePrice) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return (balance * START_REBASING_SHARE_PRICE) / sharePrice;
}

function _shares2balance(uint256 shares, uint256 sharePrice, uint256 deltaBalance, uint256 minBalance) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 rebasedBalance = (shares * sharePrice) / START_REBASING_SHARE_PRICE + deltaBalance;
    if (rebasedBalance < minBalance) {
        rebasedBalance = minBalance;
    }
    return rebasedBalance;
}

```
#### Why It's Weak:
These functions handle the conversion between balances and shares, which is a core part of the rebasing logic. The risk here is primarily due to potential rounding errors and integer division limitations in Solidity. Incorrect conversions could lead to balance inaccuracies, especially when dealing with large numbers or very small fractional amounts.

### Complexity in getBidDetail() Function

```solidity

function getBidDetail(bytes32 loanId) public view returns (uint256 collateralReceived, uint256 creditAsked) {
    // ... logic for calculating bid details ...
}

```
#### Why It's Weak:
The getBidDetail function calculates how much collateral is offered and how much debt is asked for, based on the time elapsed in the auction. The logic is complex and time-dependent, making it prone to miscalculations or manipulation, especially if not properly validated against edge cases or unexpected scenarios (like extreme market conditions).

### Handling of Negative Values in notifyPnL

```solidity

if (amount < 0) {

```
#### Why It's Weak:
The handling of losses (negative values) is complex and involves multiple state changes (e.g., adjusting surplus buffers, updating credit multipliers). If not managed accurately, it could lead to financial discrepancies in the system, such as incorrect loss accounting or multiplier adjustments.

### creditMultiplier Risk

```solidity

// update the CREDIT multiplier
                uint256 creditTotalSupply = CreditToken(_credit).totalSupply();
                uint256 newCreditMultiplier = (creditMultiplier *
                    (creditTotalSupply - loss)) / creditTotalSupply;
                creditMultiplier = newCreditMultiplier;
                emit CreditMultiplierUpdate(
                    block.timestamp,
                    newCreditMultiplier
                );

```
### Calculating the New Multiplier
- creditTotalSupply is the total supply of CREDIT tokens in the system.
- loss is the amount of bad debt that needs to be accounted for, beyond the surplus buffer.
- The new creditMultiplier is calculated by reducing the current multiplier proportionally to the ratio of the loss to the total CREDIT supply.

### Effect of the Calculation:
- The formula (creditMultiplier * (creditTotalSupply - loss)) / creditTotalSupply effectively reduces the creditMultiplier.
- If loss is significant compared to creditTotalSupply, this reduction can be substantial.
- For example, if the current multiplier is 1.0 (or 1e18 in Solidity's integer math), and the loss is 10% of the total CREDIT supply, the new multiplier would be 0.9 (or 0.9e18), representing a 10% decrease.

### Implications:
``Decrease in CREDIT Value``: The decrease in the creditMultiplier effectively lowers the value of CREDIT tokens throughout the system. This means that every CREDIT token now represents a smaller share of the system's value.

``Increased Debt for Borrowers``:  This decrease means borrowers now owe more CREDIT tokens to cover the same nominal value of debt.
