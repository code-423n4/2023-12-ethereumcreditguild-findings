## Potential Loss of Assets in emergencyAction Function due to Unchecked msg.value


Contract Name: CoreRef 

Scope: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/2376d9af792584e3d15ec9c32578daa33bb56b43/src/core/CoreRef.sol#L87-L107

### Impact 

During the security audit of the smart contract, a critical issue has been identified in the `emergencyAction` function, particularly in its handling of native coin transfers to external contracts (i.e. targets). The function allows the caller to send `msg.value` to multiple targets without ensuring that the total value sent does not exceed the targets' contributions. This oversight may lead to the loss of excess assets that remain inaccessible within the contract.

In other words, The `emergencyAction` function allows the caller to send native coins (msg.value) to multiple external contracts without verifying that the total value sent does not exceed the summation of the values sent to the targets. The excess native coins sent beyond the summation of values to the targets remain locked in the contract resulting in potential asset loss.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To mitigate the risks associated with unchecked `msg.value` in the `emergencyAction` function, it is recommended to:

Implement Validation Checks: Introduce a validation checks within the `emergencyAction` function to ensure that the total `msg.value` sent does not exceed the intended amount for external calls. No need for another for-loop to carry out that check, leverage the existing for loop and carry out the check after the loop is executed.

Refund Mechanism: Consider implementing a refund mechanism to return excess `msg.value` to the caller if it exceeds the total required for external calls. This enhances transparency and prevents asset loss.
