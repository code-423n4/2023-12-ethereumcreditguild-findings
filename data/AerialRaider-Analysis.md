High-Risk Submissions:
1. AuctionHouse Contract: Ensuring loanId is not zero, callDebt is greater than zero, and collateralReceived is greater than zero to avoid invalid auctions.
2. ERC20Gauges Contract: Implementing checks in burn, transfer, and transferFrom functions to prevent unauthorized token movement.

Medium Risk Submissions:
1. RateLimitedMinter Contract: Adding checks to prevent minting to invalid or zero addresses.
2. SimplePSM Contract: Adding security checks to various functions including mint, getBidDetail, and mintAndEnterRebase to prevent misuse.
3, GuildToken Contract: Preventing minting operations with zero amount, operations on invalid gauge addresses, and burning from a zero address.
4 CreditToken and ERC20MultiVotes Contracts: Implementing checks to prevent token minting to invalid addresses, ensuring non-zero mint and transfer amounts, and avoiding burning more tokens than an account holds.

Each submission identifies potential vulnerabilities and suggests improvements to prevent a range of issues such as unauthorized actions, invalid operations, and economic attacks. These submissions aim to enhance the overall security, robustness, and reliability of the respective contracts within the Ethereum Credit Guild ecosystem.
